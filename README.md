> Your first "object of type 'closure' is not subsettable" error message is a big milestone for an R user. Congratulations, if there was any lingering doubt, you now know that you are officially programming! Programming involves considerably more troubleshooting and debugging than many of us expected (or signed up for). The ability to solve your own problems is an incredibly powerful stealth skill that is worth cultivating with intention. This talk will help you nurture your inner problem solver, covering both general debugging methods and specific ways to implement them in the R ecosystem.

## Credits and resources

Annotated and hyperlink-y list of resources mentioned in the slides, in roughly the same order.

Restart R, often, and don't save/reload `.Rdata`.

This recommendation is explored more thoroughly in [Save source, not the workspace](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html). This mindset works best as part of a more holistic "project-oriented workflow", which is described in adjacent sections of [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/index.html).

> One of the most useful things I’ve learned from hanging out with (much) better programmers: don’t wring hands and speculate. Work a small example that reveals, confirms, or eliminates something.

Static code snippets prepared with the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org), using [`venue = "rtf"`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/rtf.html), which relies on [highlight](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php).

GIFs of code prepared with [r-lib/asciicast](https://github.com/r-lib/asciicast) plus [asciinema/asciicast2gif](https://github.com/asciinema/asciicast2gif).

This talk benefitted greatly from:

  * Regular discussions with the rest of the tidyverse / r-lib team at RStudio
    - [tidyverse org members](https://github.com/orgs/tidyverse/people)
    - [r-lib org members](https://github.com/orgs/r-lib/people)
  * Visual design and art from Christine Kuper
